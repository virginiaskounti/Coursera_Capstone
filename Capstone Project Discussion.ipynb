This has led to various improvements in road safety measures. UkCity Councils have taken various measures to improve the transport strategy to avoid crashes. The advancements in statistical and computational models have enabled us to perform thorough analysis on the effect different variables have on accident severity and this way better predict future accident rate and severity and put more safety measures in place to prevent fatalities in the shortest term possible.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "**Data**"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Data relating to traffic accidents has been made available for analysis to determine the best way to increase road safety.

Determining an accurate result from this data set will help automobile companies Leeds city council and hopefully additional councils prevent more accidents occurring in the future. This project will determine which algorithm model best improves the accuracy of predictions of road accidents and their respective severity and therefore put measures in place to prevent/eliminate them as much as possible.
